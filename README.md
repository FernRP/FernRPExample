This tool was developed by [DumoeDss](https://github.com/DumoeDss).

Smooth Normals is used to solve the problem of stroke breakage due to unsmooth model normals in runtime or editor. For more information, you can check [here](https://github.com/DumoeDss/AquaSmoothNormals).

Texture Baker can bake textures onto a mesh.
